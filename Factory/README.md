# Factory

When a method returns one of several possible classes that share a common super class

**We ultimately want classes to be generated at run time**

Letâ€™s say we want to generate some object at random - using basic programming techniques will make this very difficult. Thus a factory can be used to generate objects during run time.

Parameterized factories are the simpiliest form of a factory but can easily be implemented to illustrate the core concept of a factory.

Essentially you can have a factory class that will be passed some parameter and will return the creation of some type of class object.

```rb
public class ProductFactory{
	public Product createProduct(String ProductID){
		if (id == ID1)
			return new OneProduct();
		if (id == ID2) return
			return new AnotherProduct();
        return null;
    }
}
```
